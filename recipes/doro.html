    <h2>How to Make Doro wat</h2>
    <p>Making Ethiopian chicken stew.

</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, including neck and giblets, cut into 1-inch pieces
        </li>
        <li>¼ cup lemon juice</li>
        <li>3 cups chopped Bermuda onion</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>8 hard-boiled eggs, peeled</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the chicken in 2 cups water and lemon juice in a large bowl for 10 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Place the onion, with no fat, in a large Dutch oven or heavy pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until very dark, about 20 minutes. Stir in the butter, cayenne pepper, paprika, black pepper, and ginger, then stir in 1 more cup of water. Add the drained chicken, stirring until well-blended. Cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until the chicken is tender, about 1 hour. If a thicker stew is desired, whisk flour with 2 tablespoons of water, and stir into the pot; allow to simmer until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir in eggs; cook and stir until heated through, about 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
